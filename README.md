# icebreaker
Icebreaker was a school project in which we had to develop a mobile app
  that used some elements of location based services.
It was developed in part by me (Anthony Maldarelli), Janna Sheng, and Sofia Elyukin.
Because of the heavy dependence on the foursquare API, and our lack of web server,
  it is near impossible to pull this code and run it entirely from your local machine,
  but feel free to admire the wonderful code!
  
Icebreaker was designed to be a social app that connected users with people who are in the same location
however, instead of having some lame chat or anything on the phone, users are supposed to find people and
  conversate with them IN REAL LIFE. Users are based on proximity and shared interests.
This would be useful for passing time in a crowded public space, such as a university or a coffe shop, 
  because we all know how hard it is to just walk up to someone and start a conversation
Icebreaker would make that part easier.

The guts of the program are written in Javascript, while HTML and CSS were used for the interface. 
All personal information is aquired through the Foursquare / Swarm API, such as user info, 
  and location (users check in to find people)
